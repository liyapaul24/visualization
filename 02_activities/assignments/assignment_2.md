# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      **Example of good visualization:**
      Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mcc.rpie/viz/AnnualDegreesandCertificates_16487718324400/Awards
      Clarity:
      The stacked bar chart is easy to interpret, with distinct segments and clear labels for annual totals, enabling quick understanding of trends over time.

      Effective Use of Colors:
      The color-coded categories, along with the legend, make it straightforward to differentiate between award types.

      Supporting Details:
      The combination of a graph and a data table provides both visual and numerical context, making the visualization versatile for different audiences.

      **Example of bad visualization:**
      Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/erin.otwell/viz/Pollutionpiechart-Tablet/PollutantPieChart-Tablet
      Inappropriate Chart Type:
      The pie chart is not ideal for displaying data with multiple categories, as it makes it hard to compare proportions accurately.

      Color Confusion:
      The use of similar colors, especially multiple shades of blue and gray, makes it challenging to differentiate between pollutant sources.

      Missing Data Labels:
      The absence of numerical labels or percentages for each segment prevents viewers from understanding the exact contribution of each category.

      Poor Interactivity:
      The radio buttons for "Pollutant type" do not add meaningful insights, as the relationship between the selected type and the chart data remains unclear.





      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      **Based on the example of good visualization**
      Highlight Key Trends:
      Add annotations or callouts to draw attention to notable insights, such as the peak in awards in 2018â€“2019 or the declining trend afterward.

      Enhance Interactivity:
      Include tooltips that display detailed counts or percentages for each segment when hovered over to make the data more accessible.

     **Based on the example of bad visualization**
     Switch to a Bar Chart:
     A bar chart would allow for precise comparisons, as values could be easily displayed and understood.

     Improve Color Scheme:
     Use distinct, easily distinguishable colors for each category to enhance readability.

     Add Labels and Context:
     Include numerical values or percentages on the chart and provide a title or description that clearly links the "Pollutant type" selection to the data         displayed.




      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
