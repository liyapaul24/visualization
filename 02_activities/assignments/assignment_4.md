# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  

Note: The selected Data set is - ServiceOntario wait times (in-person)(https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/serviceontario-wait-times-in-person) which is selected from [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). All the required documents including python code, excel files are added in folder 'Assignment-4 documents' 

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

The data visualization is created using python's Matplotlib library to create the bar plot visualization. 

    > Who is your intended audience? 

The intended audience are:
Policy Makers and Administrators: To assess the performance of publicly and privately operated Service Ontario centers.
General Public: To increase awareness of wait times and service efficiency.
Data Analysts: To showcase insights from the dataset for improvements
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The visualization aims to convey:
    A comparison of yearly average wait times (percentage of customers who waited less than 20 minutes) between publicly and privately operated Service Ontario centers.
    Key Insight: Whether public or private centers consistently perform better in terms of shorter wait times.
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
    Substantive Principles: Focused on presenting accurate, summarized data (yearly averages), and also ensured that all relevant data was included without overwhelming the audience with raw values.
    Perceptual Principles: Used distinct colors to differentiate the two types of centers clearly, Added data labels to the top of the bars to aid quick comprehension.
    Aesthetic Principles: Balanced the plot by giving equal visual weight to public and private data and also used a clean layout with a descriptive title and axis labels for clarity.

    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    Reproducibility in Python: I ensured all steps were performed programmatically in Python, from cleaning the dataset to generating the plot. Dependencies, like Matplotlib and Pandas, were documented in the environment file for reproducibility.
    Excel Export: I exported the cleaned dataset to an Excel file with clear sheet names, enabling easy reproduction of the visualizations using Excel or other tools.
    Impact of Non-Reproducibility:If the visualization tool were non-reproducible, it would reduce trust in the results and limit opportunities for others to verify or build upon the analysis.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    Used readable fonts and a clear title to ensure the plot is understandable. Applied color coding with distinguishable colors and added data labels to the bars.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization? 
    Service Ontario Staff: Insights from this visualization might highlight areas for operational improvement.
    General Public: Increased transparency might help customers decide which type of center to visit for shorter wait times. 
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    Included:
    Yearly Average Wait Times, to give a high-level summary and make the data comparable across time and added Public and Private Center Data together for a side-by-side comparison
    Excluded:
    Detailed monthly data to avoid cluttering the visualization and overwhelming the audience.
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    The "underwater labour" included:
    Data Cleaning: Filled the missing records with the means value of the centre and also Aggregated monthly data into yearly averages for simplification.
    Preprocessing: data validated seprately as public and private datasets.
    Coding: Written Python scripts for data analysis and visualization. Debugging and refining the visualization code.
    Testing: Ensuring the visualization was legible and effective across different screen sizes and resolutions.
    Exporting Data: Creating a user-friendly Excel file to facilitate additional analysis in alternative tools.

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
